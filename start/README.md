## *Hello world*

- [Dart Language](#dart-language)

- [JavaScript Language](#javascript-language)

```bash
cd start
```

We have code example in folders **dart** and **js**. 

Follow me:

```bash
dart dart/hello.dart
node js/hello.js
```

You receive: **Hello world!**

## *Dart Language*

Code example:

![](https://i.ibb.co/Xy096xH/dart-main.png)

**main()** is where the application starts executing. The special, *required*, top-level function where application execution starts

**print()** A handy way to display output. You can use either "..."  or  '...'

## *JavaScript Language*

Code example:

![](https://i.ibb.co/LgDM4C7/dart-main-1.png)

You can print the same string, except this time to the JavaScript console. Like **print()** in dart, using "..." or '... ' are accepted. 

Unlike **dart**, JavaScript no have **main()**, because the entire code block is effectively one big `main` . In JavaScript, global code can have all of the constructs function code can have, and has stepwise execution, just like functions do. See then and then. See [here](http://es5.github.io/#x10.4.1) and [here](http://es5.github.io/#x10.4.3) for have more informations.
